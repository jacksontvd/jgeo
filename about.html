<h1>What is Jr. Geometry?</h1>



<p>
"This is a grad student run seminar, for grad students, no professors allowed (not that we don't love our geometry professors!). The purpose of this seminar is to do a few things: build community among grad students working in geometry and geometry adjacent fields, provide a friendly and low pressure space for graduate students to practice giving talks, and to give geometry students a way to find out what other students in the department are interested in!
</p>

<p>
Note that geometry means a lot of things to a lot of different people at UT: some topics include, algebraic geometry, differential geometry/topology, mirror symmetry, tropical geometry, geometric representation theory, category theory, homotopy theory, geometric measure theory, arithmetic geometry, topological quantum field theory, and more! And if even if you don't study these things all are welcome to attend.
</p>

<p>
We encourage any incoming students especially to check it out. Please note that if you're a first year or in general new to the seminar there will not be pressure to talk!"
