<li>   September 07: Riccardo Pedrotti
<p>
Title: The symplectic proof of the Rectangular Peg Problem by Greene and Lobb
</p>
<p>
Abstract:As the title suggests, I'll talk about the Rectangular Peg Problem and how symplectic geometry was used to 
  find a positive solution to a stronger version of it by Greene and Lobb in May 2020. This seemingly easy problem asks us to find 4 points 
  on any given smooth Jordan curve in C that correspond to the vertices of a rectangle. Greene and Lobb proved that you can find 4 points that 
  are the vertices of a rectangle that it's similar to any given rectangle. Surprisingly, the square peg problem over continuous Jordan curve 
  (formulated in 1911) is still open. The first half of this talk will be very accessible to everyone, the second half will use some elementary 
  notion from symplectic geometry.

<li>   September 14: Rok Gregoric
<p>
Title: Non-connective Algebraic Geometry
</p>
<p>
Abstract: Homotopical generalizations of algebraic geometry (be it derived or spectral) begins by replacing ordinary commutative rings in the foundations of 
  algebraic geometry with some homotopical version of commutative rings (commutative differential graded algebras, simplicial commutative rings, E_infty-rings, 
  etc.). Tradition dictates that we nonetheless require these homotopical rings to be connective, i.e. (depending on the choice of foundations) to have no non-zero
  negative homotopy groups or no non-zero positive-degree homotopy groups. Breaking this taboo and admitting non-connective homotopical rings as affine objects
  leads to non-connective algebraic geometry. It is well-known to admit some unusual, less-geometric, and all-around pathological behavior. In this talk, we will
  explore some of those, as well as some examples that suggest why we might nonetheless sometimes want to put ourselves in such a setting.
</p></li>

<li>   September 21: Germ&aacute;n Stefanich
<p>
Title: Categorification of the Radon transform
</p>
<p>
Abstract: The Brylinski-Radon transform provides a relationship between the categories of D-modules on dual projective spaces. In this talk I'll review its 
  statement, and explain an analogue in the context of noncommutative algebraic geometry, which relates the 2-categories of categorical sheaves on dual 
  projective spaces. Time permitting, I'll explain how this categorical Radon transform features in recent advances in the study of derived categories of 
  projective varieties.
</p></li>

<li>   September 28: Tynan Ochse
<p>
Title: Condensed Mathematics
</p>
<p>
Abstract: Is there a common playing field for complex, real, and rigid analytic geometry? This is one of the driving questions behind Scholze and 
  Clausen's "condensed mathematics". In this talk we will give a basic overview of how one can redo point-set topology to accommodate certain homological 
  shortcomings of the category of topological groups, why this viewpoint seems "natural", and what interesting objects pop out of the general theory.
</p></li>

<li>  October 05: Saad Slaoui
<p>
Title: Weil’s Rosetta stone from the viewpoint of covering space theory
</p>
<p>
Abstract: This talk will aim to motivate a far-reaching analogy between arithmetic curves associated to number fields, algebraic curves defined over a finite 
  field, and Riemann surfaces/algebraic curves over the complex numbers known as Weil’s Rosetta stone. We will mostly focus on the theory of branched coverings 
  and its incarnations in all three contexts, leading to various versions of the Riemann-Hurwitz theorem and a geometric perspective on some basic results in 
  algebraic number theory. Time permitting, we will hint at how many areas of modern mathematical activity can be traced back to this paradigm, including 
  arithmetic and algebraic Riemann-Roch theorems, the classical and geometric Langlands programs, and the Riemann-Weil conjecture as a finite field analogue 
  of the Riemann hypothesis.
