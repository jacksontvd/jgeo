Title: The (Symplectic) Camel and the eye of a needle
</p>
<p>
Abstract: Many of you have heard the parable of the camel and the eye of a needle "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God". Symplectic geometry (in its role as the one and only geometry given to us by a superior entity) has an analogous result concerning balls symplectically embedded into cylinders: if the radius of the ball is bigger than the radius of the cylinder then there is no way to symplectically embed the former inside the latter. 
As it happens with math, results that are somewhat easy to state turn out to be very tricky to prove and in fact we will need to rely on some "advance" techniques (by now standard) in symplectic geometry. 
We will follow Gromov's proof of the theorem which makes use of pseudo-holomorphic curves and some facts about area minimising curves. Everyone is welcome to attend! Prerequisites will be kept very low, I will blackbox something but hopefully the main ideas will be clear.

Title: Equivariant cohomology and (conditional) oriented matroid. 
</p>
<p>
Abstract: According to Taoist wisdom, "Truths, if expressible by language, are not general truths". This has an interesting manifestation in math: theorems, if relying on geometry, are not general theorems. Therefore, I am going to talk about non-geometry. Given a collection of linear hyperplanes in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), one can construct two spaces \(M_1\) and \(M_3\). \(M_1\) is the complement of the union of all hyperplanes, while \(M_3\) is the complement of \(R^{3d}\) of the union of corresponding subspaces of codimension 3. The cohomology of \(M_1\), \(H^*(M_1)\) is a boring ring with an interesting filtration. Gel'fand and Varchenko gave presentations for \(H^*(M_1)\) and later on de Longueville & Schultz gave presentations for \(H^*(M_3)\). It happens to be the case that \(H^*(M_3)\) is exactly the associated graded algebra of \(H^*(M_1)\).  Moseley realized that the reason for this connection lies in the fact that both rings are specializations of the torus-equivariant cohomology of \(M_3\). Oriented matroids are combinatorial abstractions of real hyperplane arrangements. This is a vast generalization since almost all matroids don't come from hyperplane arrangements. All the cohomology rings mentioned above only depend on the underlying oriented matroids, so in principle, the above phenomenon should still hold even if the space \(M_1\) and \(M_3\) don't exist. This is proved in full generality in a joint work with Dorpalen-Barry and Proudfoot. Bodies die and vanish, but souls don't. In a similar way, cohomology exists without a space, for geometry dies and vanishes, but combinatorics doesn't.

Title: GIT quotients
</p>
<p>
Abstract: Let's says you have a group G acting on a variety (or scheme) X and you want to take the quotient. Intuitively you may want to take some version of the "orbit space" but it turns out there is not always an obvious way to put a scheme structure on it. Geometric invariant theory (GIT) gives us a way to solve this problem. The simplest solution is given by the affine GIT quotient, which is given by taking Spec of G-invariant functions on X. If X is an affine variety, points in the affine quotient will turn out to correspond to closed orbits in X. In particular, if G is finite we recover the orbit space as a scheme, although in general the behavior can be pathological. Thus sometimes a more sophisticated answer is needed, which is given by the projective GIT quotient. We shall study both of these and their relationship, with one key example being Kleinian singularities (quotients of A^2 by finite groups). Time permitting we will briefly talk about Hamiltonian reductions and Nakajima quiver varieties. No background will be assumed.
