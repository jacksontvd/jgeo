Yixian Wu
<p>Abstract: 
Gromov-Witten invariants are the answers to questions like: How many curves of degree \(d\) are there in
\(\mathbb{P}^2\) that pass through
\(3d-1\) general points? Though the computation of them are in general hard, the property that they are deformation invariants provides a way that leads to simplification. In particular, it is desirable to have a Gromov-Witten theory on a degenerate target space. Logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory provides a beautiful answer to the question. In this talk, I will first give an introduction to the ordinary GW-invariants, and then talk about log GW-theory and how we can use it to decompose the ordinary GW-invariants into log GW-invariants over certain tropical types.
</p></li>
<li>   September 15: 
Will Stewart
<p>Abstract:  The aim of this talk will be to give a non-intimidating introduction to the Cobordism Hypothesis. First proposed by Baez and Dolan and later proved by Hopkins and Lurie, the Cobordism Hypothesis provides a remarkable classification of fully extended topological field theories. We will introduce the main concepts that underpin this theorem, such as duality in symmetric monoidal categories. We will sketch a proof of the theorem in dimension 1, before talking about its higher dimensional versions.
</p></li>
<li>   September 22: 
Richard Wong
<p>Abstract: One problem of interest in modular representation theory is in computing the group of endo-trivial modules.  In homotopy theory, this group is known as the Picard group of the stable module category \(\mathrm{StMod}(kG)\). This group was computed by work of Carlson-Thevenaz, using group cohomology and the theory of support varieties of modules.  
<br>
Recently, work of Mathew and Mathew-Stojanoska introduced a new, homotopical approach to this computation through faithful Galois descent.  While Galois descent often holds in \(\mathrm{StMod}(kG)\), it is too much to expect faithful Galois descent.  Nevertheless, I show that one can extend their methods to the non-faithful setting in the case that \(G\) is a quaternion or generalized quaternion group.  This is a practice research talk.

<li>   September 29: 
Rok Gregoric
<p>Abstract: Flat connections, also known as local systems, are of importance in various areas of math. They are important in representation theory, and mathematical physics, to name only a few. A light generalization are D-modules, which come equipped with an action by differential operators. Many of us in this Seminar, and our advisors even more so, deal with D-modules in characteristic 0 on a nigh-daily basis.

In this talk, we will take a journey through the theory of D-modules in positive characteristic, focusing on some particularly interesting phenomena that occur and set it apart from the more-familiar theory in characteristic zero (Frobenius descent, crystals). If time permits, we will end on a version of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in that context, due to Emmerton-Kisin and Bhatt-Lurie.

<li>  October 06: 
Riccardo Pedrotti
<p>Abstract: As the title suggests, I'll talk about the Rectangular Peg Problem and how symplectic geometry was used to find a positive solution to a stronger version of it by Greene and Lobb last May. This seemingly easy problem asks us to find 4 points on any given smooth Jordan curve in C that correspond to the vertices of a rectangle. Greene and Lobb proved that you can find 4 points that are the vertices of a rectangle that it's similar to any given rectangle. Surprisingly, the square peg problem over continuous Jordan curve (formulated in 1911) is still open.

<li>  October 13: 
Joakim Asger Faergeman
<p>Abstract: We shall concern ourselves with category O, which is the abelican category consisting of certain nice representations of a complex semisimple Lie algebra. While we cover the basics, our main goal is to formulate and describe the progress made towards the proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture. In particular, we highlight the work made by Verma, Jantzen and Beilinson-Bernstein.
