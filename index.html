<li>   January 17: Isaac Martin
<p>
Title: Fans of Geometry Rejoice
</p>
<p>
Abstract: What does combinatorics have to do with schemes? In the spirit of adding more representation to the Bernd Siebert/Sam Payne brand of geometry, I&rsquo;ll give an elementary answer to the question by introducing you to toric geometry. We&rsquo;ll see how you can build a handy class of complex schemes using nothing more than polyhedral fans. What&rsquo;s better, we&rsquo;ll see how this allows one to give extremely concrete answers to sometimes nebulous questions such as &ldquo;is this scheme smooth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what is the divisor class group of this scheme?&rdquo;, time allowing.</p></li>

<li>  February 07: Joakim F&aelig;rgeman
<p>
Title: The Brown Representability Theorem
</p>
<p>
Abstract: We provide an exposition of the Brown representability theorem. The theorem gives sufficient conditions for a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of based CW-complexes to the category of pointed sets to be representable. In particular, it proves the representability of cohomology theories satisfying the Eilenbeerg-Steenrod axioms.

<li>  February 14: Jacob Gaiter
<p>
Title: From Mechanics to Geometry
</p>
<p>
Abstract: In this talk we see how the progression of analytical mechanics, from Newtonian to Lagrangian to Hamiltonian, and careful examination of the equations describing Hamiltonian mechanics lead to the definition of a symplectic manifold and simple proofs of seemingly non-trivial results from classical mechanics in a generalized setting through the language of differential forms. We will observe how a natural symplectic form may be given to the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold and how to recover a generalization of Lagrangian mechanics under a certain restriction.
</p></li>

<li>  February 21: Jackson Van Dyke
<p>
Title: Equivariance and coherence
</p>
<p>
Abstract: After reviewing the metaplectic representation, I will explain how we can think about the projectivity of the symplectic action as an &quot;anomaly&quot;. Then we will consider 3 and 4-dimensional finite gauge theory, where the automorphism groups are now higher groups. The group cocycle capturing the projectivity in the metaplectic case will be replaced by similar cohomological data characterizing these higher automorphism group(oid)s.

Title: An unperturbed approach to Morse homology: Morse-Bott Homology </p>
<p>
Abstract: In this seminar I will introduce the Morse-Bott approach to Morse homology, which doesn&rsquo;t necessitate to perturb a real valued function to be a Morse function. Why is that important? In the spirit of &ldquo;transversality is the opposite of symmetry&rdquo;, Morse functions almost always destroy the inner symmetries of a space, i.e. don&rsquo;t take them into account. Morse-Bott functions instead are a little bit more flexible in that regard and sometimes let us preserve these symmetries. I will spend 10 minutes recalling what Morse homology is (but you will appreciate the talk more if you are familiar with that already) and then talk about different approaches to Morse-Bott homology. Time permitting I will mention a couple of applications of Morse Bott homology (in symplectic geometry for example) but do not expect anything too detailed since I&rsquo;m currently learning it myself :)
