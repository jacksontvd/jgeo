<ul id="id01">
<li>    January 25: Tom Gannon
<p>
Title:  Line Bundles in Representation Theory: The Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem
</p>
<p>Abstract: After reviewing the notion of a line bundle, we will give a general algorithm for constructing line bundles on the flag varieties/manifolds, which are certain varieties/manifolds associated reductive groups like GL_n or SL_n.
  We'll discuss how one can use this algorithm to construct all finite dimensional representations of a given reductive group, known as the Borel-Weil theorem,
  and discuss its generalization to "higher cohomology groups" in characteristic 0 known as the Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem. Time permitting, we'll discuss Kempf vanishing theorem,
  a partial generalization of the characteristic p version of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem.
</p></li>
<li>   February 01: Charlie Reid
<p>Title: Lagrangian Cobordism
</p>
<p>Abstract: Lagrangian Cobordism is a simple equivalence relation on the lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold, introduced by Vladimir Arnold in 1980.
  We will start by introducing some fundamental notions of symplectic geometry, hamiltonian flows and lagrangian submanifolds. Then, we will define lagrangian cobordism and give some examples.
  Finally, to add some fanciness, we will talk about Nadler and Tanaka's construction of an infinity category of lagrangian cobordisms.
  In their special setting, they even construct a stable infinity category, so I will attempt to say a few words about what that means.
</p></li>

<li>   February 08: Joakim Færgeman
<p>Title: Geometric Langlands and its daughters
</p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk, we concern ourselves with the Geometric Langlands conjecture and its variants.
  More specifically, we motivate the Geometric Langlands conjecture in its current form by recalling the history leading up to it. We will also consider some new exciting variants of the conjecture and how these are related.
</p></li>

<li>   February 15: Riccardo Pedrotti
<p>Title: An introduction to the Arnold Conjecture, or how I learned Floer Homology
</p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk I will talk about the Arnold conjecture, which is concerned with the minimum number of fixed points that an Hamiltonian symplectomorphism on a (closed) manifold must have.
  This question was asked in 1972 by V. Arnold in his book “Arnold’s problem” and led to the birth of Floer Homology, introduced by A. Floer in the late 80s.
  Interestingly enough, the history of the Arnold conjecture has some ties with our Math department: B. Siebert and other people extended the proof of the conjecture to any compact symplectic manifold,
  while A. Blumberg (together with M. Abouzaid) increased the lowerbound on the number of fixed points.
  Lastly, let’s not forget R. Pedrotti who keeps on forgetting the difference between “weak” and “strong” Arnold conjecture… But that’s a story for another time maybe
